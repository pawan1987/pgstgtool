=== 0.1.1 / 2008-07-21

* 1 major enhancement
  * A complete rewrite! We won't bother attempting to wrap complex lvm
    operations, but instead provide LVM.raw() command. The wrapper now focuses
    purely on translating lvm lv/vg/pv data into the most useful ruby objects
    possible. The arguments passed to the underlying binaries have been broken
    out into a ruby-lvm-attributes package.
